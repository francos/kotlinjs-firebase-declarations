# Kotlin/JS external definitions for Firebase JS SDK

The definitions have been generated by Dukat and later refined a little by me. Each module of the original Firebase SDK has been split into a different publication to overcome the automatic injection of the Firebase SDK when importing it, more information [here](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/how-to-import-firebase-sdk-modules-separately-in-kotlin-js/16985/10?u=lamba92).

It is build with Kotlin 1.4.10 with both legacy and IR compiler and uses Gradle Metadata, so be sure to have Gradle Metadata enabled!

## WARNING

Those declarations have not been tested. Any PR is welcome!

## Usage

To initialize an App use [`firebase.initializeApp()`](/packages/core/src/main/kotlin/firebase/index.firebase.module_firebase.kt#L38) then call the methods available on it.
 
To import in your Gradle project:
```kotlin
repositories {
    maven("https://dl.bintray.com/lamba92/com.github.lamba92")
}

dependenceis {

    val kotlinJsFirebaseDeclarationsVersion: String by project 
%%%REPLACE-DEFINITIONS%%%
}
```

Or if using the Kotlin configuration DSL:
```kotlin
kotlin {
    sourceSets {
        val main: KotlinSourceSets by getting {

            val kotlinJsFirebaseDeclarationsVersion: String by project 
%%%REPLACE-DEFINITIONS-2%%%
        }
    }
}
```
